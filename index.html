    <h1 align="center">My Bitch</h1>

    <p>Her name, Mona. That's the name  ny big brother Brian gave her and it stuck till now close to 10 years later.
    She's a mixture of a Japanese Spitz and some other dod breed that i don't know of.
    10 years down the line and she doesn't have a family of her own since she has never breeded, weird I know.
    I tend to believe she's a nun in the canine world!

    <p> Her bff is a Cock who was brought to our home 2 years ago. They have a love-hate relationship which works for them.
    The weird part of this relaionship is that sometimes, the cock tries to jump on top of Mona and hump it, this scene is always funny as hell!!
    </p>

    <h3>Here's a list of Mona's Favorite ativities</h3>

      <ul>
        <li>Endless running without a cause</li>
        <li>Kicking down the rubbish bin</li>
        <li>Removing washed kaundry from the hanging lines</li>
        <li>Chasing away breeding mates, she loves doing this a lot.</li>

      </ul>

      <p> All in all shes part of our family and of course she's here to stay</p>
